# About

This is an easy to use report template for reproducible research. The main idea
is to combine `GNU Makefile`, \LaTeX, `markdown` and `knitr` to generate
beautifully-looking reproducible reports easily. Any number of independent
`rmarkdown` documents can be combined with arbitrary number of plain markdown
files to form a single PDF report.

Take a look a `example_report.pdf` to get the idea.

# How to use

Clone it, edit files under the folder `content` as necessary, and call `make`.

# Requirements

 * `pandoc`
 * `R` with `knitr` / `rmarkdown`
 * `LaTeX`
 * `GNU Make`

# Introduction

This is an easy to use report template for reproducible research. The main idea
is to combine `GNU Makefile`, \LaTeX, `markdown` and `knitr` to generate
beautifully-looking reproducible reports easily. Any number of independent
`rmarkdown` documents can be combined with arbitrary number of plain markdown
files to form a single PDF report.
